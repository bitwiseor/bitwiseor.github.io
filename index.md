## Well, hello there.

If you're reading this, you've made your way to my GitHub Pages site. Enjoy your stay.

### Finite State of Mind

I'm thinking about starting a project. An educational project, probably. What will I teach? Probably C, or cryptography. Or both. Or automata. The world is my oyster, and Finite State of Mind is a placeholder name.

I'm leaving the default stuff below, so I don't forget how Markdown works. Look forward to changes!

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bitwiseor/bitwiseor.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
